# Advanced Calculator for Linear Algebra and Matrix Operations

Welcome to the Advanced Calculator! This Python project offers functionality for various linear algebra calculations and sophisticated matrix operations. It covers a range of mathematical procedures including:

## Features

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Calculate eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors for a 2x2 matrix.

### Homogeneous Systems
Solve two-dimensional and three-dimensional homogeneous systems of equations.

### Gaussian-Seidel and Jacobi Methods
Apply numerical methods like Gaussian-Seidel and Jacobi for solving linear systems with three or two variables respectively.

## How to Use

### Getting Started
1. Choose the operation you want to perform by entering the corresponding number.
2. Input the required coefficients or matrix elements as prompted.

### Operations
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors (Option 0)**
  - Enter matrix elements to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
  
- **Two-dimensional Homogeneous (Option 1)**
  - Input coefficients of a 2D homogeneous system for solutions.

- **Three-dimensional Homogeneous (Option 2)**
  - Enter coefficients of a 3D homogeneous system to find solutions.

- **Gaussian-Seidel Method for 3 variables (Option 3)**
